API changes
   * MBEDTLS_TIMING_C now requires MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME to be enabled in the
     TF-PSA-Crypto configuration, unless MBEDTLS_TIMING_ALT is enabled.
     As a benefit, platforms where the default implementation is not
     supported now only need to implement MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_MS_TIME_ALT.
   * When MBEDTLS_TIMING_ALT is enabled, the function
     mbedtls_timing_get_timer() now returns unsigned long long instead
     of unsigned long.

Bugfix
   * mbedtls_timing_get_delay() now correctly treats a timer as expired
     after more than 2^32 ms (about 49 days) on platforms where long is
     a 32-bit type.
